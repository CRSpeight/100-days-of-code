# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I went through the beta freecode camp curriculum since it was turned on to me by a peer at a local meetup, I had gone through most of the freecodecamp normal front end curriculum a few weeks ago so I appreciated the refreshed with some added content. After I did one pomodoro on that I focused the remaining time before bed on the Tribute Page project which I have been putting off. I had already populated it with text before, but decided to sit down and experiment with styling and I'm decently happy with the results after not a whole lot of work.

**Thoughts**: I learned a few things, mostly how to better manipulate background images to behave in a more modern fashion (and not have horrible tiling), but I probably need to revisit the project for mobile compatibility in the future. Mostly I need to work on my design skills, I did not find myself particularly challenged by the CSS configuration for this project, but more by my own lack of skill in coming up with an attractive page design.

### Day 2: September 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Blasted through the beta FCC tutorials on CSS and got a good portion into Applied Visual Design. Slowed down a bit there as that was all new content, but oddly more stuff that I tackled when I was younger. After collecting some feedback, I modified my tribute page to be more mobile friendly using bootstrap columns. After that I started working on the portfolio, mostly experimenting using bootstrap framework.

**Thoughts**: Still struggling with making things attractive at this stage more than the actual hurdles of CSS, my brain just doesn't seem to be particularly creative about webpage design/layout, still looking for ideas/inspiration.

### Day 3: September 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more of the FCC beta page on Applied visual design and then worked on portfolio a bit, time was very slim today due to working a 15 hour day at the normal job.

**Thoughts**: Just trying to keep up the habit today even when my normal job is rough!

### Day 4: September 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Concentrated on portfolio project. 

**Thoughts**: Red eye work days are really adding up on me, trying to keep this habit going though no matter what.

### Day 5: October 1st, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on learning bootstrap nav bars and trying to implement them in my portfolio project!

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately missed yesterday and got pretty down on myself, but I looked over the rules and it pretty much said I could miss one day (but not two in a row) as long as I make up for it, which is why I'm still considering this day 5, instead of 6!

### Day 6: October 3rd, 2017

**Today's Progress**: More tinkering with bootstrap navbar options, worked on an implementation of a floating nav-bar with anchors to page sections. Having various issues due to padding issues on the top of the page at different screen sizes though and I'm being stubborn about it!

**Thoughts**: Missed yesterday due to hospital stay (i'm fine though, was for a test). Feeling good though, trying to stay motivated until I establish the habit!

### Day 7: October 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked on powershell scripts! Trying out a side project to see if something is doable for work (automated creation of user accounts across multiple e-mail services). Having some issue with some parts of our network not being available from every physical location. 

**Thoughts**: Missed another day yesterday, decided going forward I'm not going to really note it unless I feel like there is a reason. Life is just so busy, and even if I'm doing this every other day, I feel like I'm making progress. On that note, next week I'll be in portland at a conference... so it'll be interesting to see how I get this done!

**Link(s) to work**: Not included as it has some private daily job information.

### Day 8: October 7th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did some various challenges online today to keep myself sharp, mostly the reddit learnprogramming ones. 

**Thoughts**: Think one of the reasons I'm being unmotivated currently is the relatively simple nature of the portfolio project, right now I seem to enjoy the javascript portions much more than the CSS/design ones. Thinking about jumping over to the API projects and then work on the portfolio intermittenlty. 

### Day 1: February 21st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did 100 of the FCC lessons to refresh my skills.  

**Thoughts**: Rekindled my love of coding, had a rough spell lately but decided to get back on the horse and refocus my personal time on improving myself and my life. I went to a FCC meetup on Monday (even dragged a friend), recreated my account and decided to go through lessons to get rid of some of the rust on my skills. Excited to get back on this challenge! Implementing pomodoro technique again which is really helping my focus!

### Day 2: February 22nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did quite a few more FCC lessons.

**Thoughts**: Already feeling back in the swing of things today again, almost back to the challenge portion of FreeCodeCamp. Didn't make as much progress as expected as FreeCodeCamps site was having some various issues and kept going down. Anniversary with the GF this weekend so may miss a day but packing my laptop this weekend in case I find some time!

### Day 3: February 24th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Wrapping up the FCC front end lessons, completed #200 today!

**Thoughts**: Missed yesterday due to anniversary, don't feel too guilty as I literally had no spare time between work and celebrations. Back on the horse today and should get some more time in tomorrow. I'm glad things are coming back to me more and more... I thought I was going to feel like I had to totally start over! On to projects and challenges now!

### Day 4: February 25th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed the freeCodeCamp jQuery, Javascript and Object oriented front end sections as well as a few challenges. Only lessons I have left at this point are the JSON portions, on my own from now on! 

**Thoughts**: Really hoping I can get over this hump where I have stalled out in the past when I reached the project portions. Oddly, I don't think my issue is the coding portion of these projects, it's the visual portion... I don't feel like a very confident or competent graphic designer on my own. 

### Day 5: February 26th, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed 10 of the algorithm scripting challenges on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Brain is sufficiently meltyed Only issues I really had were struggling with regex entries and global argument passing into nested functions (which doesn't work, but knowledge is power!).

### Day 6: February 27th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Got the basic algorithms done, along with the JSON APIs/AJax and all the video challenges done on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Now I'm onto the hard part of FreeCodeCamp, all the lessons are done unless they release the beta soon, so from here on out it's mostly on me with no more hand holding. Debating on doing an online course to round out my knowledge. Also will be on vacation a bit next week so trying to find some resources to take with me as I will have limited time to actually code on my computer for a few days. 

### Day 7: February 28th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Got first intermediate algorithm done on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Day was very hard and long due to work. I'm only on a handful of hours to sleep and 16+ hours of work, but I squeezed some time in... and now I rest.

### Day 8: March 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Got second intermediate algorithm done on freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Another long day, took a bit of a much needed break from work to get some sleep, didn't have a whole lot of extra coding time unfortunately. Hoping this weekend provides a much needed respite so I can do some more challenges. 

### Day 9: March 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Pivoted a bit today now that I'm in the freecodecamp section of projects to do some project oriented training. Went through the first portion of Watch And Code, bit of a refresher so far but hoping after all the good things I heard. 

**Thoughts**: Realized I stopped before day 9 last time, yay overcoming hurdles! Hoping I can go MUCH further this time, trying to stay pumped!

### Day 10: March 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Got up to version 3 of the coursework on Watch and Code. Worked on various intermediate FreeCodeCamp algorithm challenges. 

**Thoughts**: Still enjoying watch and code! Hoping to get to some newer knowledge in the next section which focuses more on objects.

### Day 11: March 4th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Did versions 3-4 of Watch and Code.

**Thoughts**: Glad I decided to start doing Watch and Code, been a great resource so far, while it has been a good rehash of a lot of subjects the portions on objects and methods so far have made me feel much more confident. I'm going to take Watch and Code up on their suggestion and focus on that course until it is completed, but I still have a Free Code Camp meeting tomorrow I'm going to (locally), and I'm bringing a friend again! Hoping at the very least I can keep learning and networking. 

### Day 12: March 5th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Completed one more intermediate algorithm at FreeCodeCamp and completed version 5 of Watch and Code

**Thoughts**: Went to FreeCodeCamp meetup tonight with a friend, even though I didn't socialize much it was good to see other people and where they are on the journey. Going with a friend has also kept me motivated to keep going, as well, it puts some perspective on things when I'm helping someone else. Almost half complete at Watch and Code as well!


### Day 13: March 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Over 50% done with watch and code!

**Thoughts**: Been a real busy week but I've been keeping up! I will be out of town for the next few days, may be Sunday or Monday before I have enough time at a computer... I'm not going to count me as having failed the challenge though, I'm not sure if purists would disagree but I'm only going to consider it a fail if I have time but I don't make it.

### Day 14: March 12th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Got three intermediate challenges done on FreeCodeCamp! 

**Thoughts**: Back from my vacation today, feeling pretty out of it still from all the driving but I'm glad to be back at coding. I decided to pivot back to doing some FreeCodeCamp challenges and somehow was feeling much better equipped after the Watch and Code stuff, even though I took a break for a few days. I don't feel better at the syntax or anything, but I feel like my ability to break down the problems is much better.

### Day 15: March 13th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Got two more intermediate algorithms done on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Didn't quite get where I wanted tonight, approaching the half way mark with the intermediate challenges... sadly think I'v done all the 'easy' ones now, going to be a bit of a battle getting through the rest.

### Day 16: March 14th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Got three more intermediate algorithms done on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: Really banging my head into the remainder of these challenges, going to spend some time doing a course on Udemy after this (Colt Steele Web Developer bootcamp) for a bit of a change of pace. Thankfully have a pretty clear weekend for once so hoping I can get some good long study sessions in. 

### Day 17: March 15th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Worked on FreeCodeCamp challenges, but didn't manage to finalize any of them. 

**Thoughts**: Feeling a bit frustrated at my lack of progress tonight, not sure if I should push through them and grind out these challenges or work on my knowledge level, but I've also had a very long day and week. 

### Day 18: March 16th, 2018

**Today's Progress**:  Managed to finish up 4 more intermediate freecodecamp challenges.

**Thoughts**: Feeling much better today, I did have to get a hint for one of them but the first hint was sufficient to get me on the right track. Of the 4-5 I have left I'm only really having trouble understanding one that pass multiple arguments in when calling the function in this weird format functionToCall(a)(b)... and not sure how to deal with this programmatically or even search for the right answer. Still early in the day though so may do some more.

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
