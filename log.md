# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I went through the beta freecode camp curriculum since it was turned on to me by a peer at a local meetup, I had gone through most of the freecodecamp normal front end curriculum a few weeks ago so I appreciated the refreshed with some added content. After I did one pomodoro on that I focused the remaining time before bed on the Tribute Page project which I have been putting off. I had already populated it with text before, but decided to sit down and experiment with styling and I'm decently happy with the results after not a whole lot of work.

**Thoughts**: I learned a few things, mostly how to better manipulate background images to behave in a more modern fashion (and not have horrible tiling), but I probably need to revisit the project for mobile compatibility in the future. Mostly I need to work on my design skills, I did not find myself particularly challenged by the CSS configuration for this project, but more by my own lack of skill in coming up with an attractive page design.

### Day 2: September 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Blasted through the beta FCC tutorials on CSS and got a good portion into Applied Visual Design. Slowed down a bit there as that was all new content, but oddly more stuff that I tackled when I was younger. After collecting some feedback, I modified my tribute page to be more mobile friendly using bootstrap columns. After that I started working on the portfolio, mostly experimenting using bootstrap framework.

**Thoughts**: Still struggling with making things attractive at this stage more than the actual hurdles of CSS, my brain just doesn't seem to be particularly creative about webpage design/layout, still looking for ideas/inspiration.

### Day 3: September 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked through more of the FCC beta page on Applied visual design and then worked on portfolio a bit, time was very slim today due to working a 15 hour day at the normal job.

**Thoughts**: Just trying to keep up the habit today even when my normal job is rough!

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
